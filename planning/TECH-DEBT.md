# Technical-debt register

Where agents record what they had to work *around* rather than *on*, so it can
be paid down deliberately instead of rediscovered.

**Every agent appends here as part of finishing.** Not a separate task and not
optional: an agent that has just spent a session inside a crate knows things
about it that no later reader will, and that knowledge is otherwise lost when
its context ends. Recording it costs a paragraph.

## What belongs here

- **A file that has outgrown its module.** Say what the seams are — "`demux.rs`
  is 1986 lines and the EBML walk, the track table and the cue index never call
  each other" is actionable; "demux.rs is long" is not.
- **A design that fought you.** An interface you had to route around, a type
  that means two things, an invariant enforced by convention rather than by the
  compiler. The `Muxer::add_stream` gap that made `framecrc` print the wrong
  time base sat unrecorded for weeks and cost a full agent session once it
  finally mattered.
- **Duplication the `dup-check` gate cannot see** — two functions that do the
  same thing under different names, a table transcribed into three crates.
- **A comment or doc that is now wrong.** Not cosmetic: three separate bugs
  this month were in code whose comment described the correct behaviour while
  the code did something else, and the comment is why nobody looked.
- **A test that cannot fail**, or that pins a point-in-time fact rather than an
  invariant. Several tests here passed happily while the code they covered
  wrote unreadable files.
- **An API with no caller.** `cargo xtask dead-code`'s orphan list is a list of
  promises nobody has kept; if you added to it, say who is going to call it.

## What does not belong here

Style preferences, "I would have structured this differently", and anything you
can fix in the change you are already making — fix it there instead. This is a
register of things too large or too far outside your ownership to fix in
passing, not a list of opinions.

## How to write a row

Name the file and the specific problem, say what it cost you or would cost the
next person, and propose the seam if you can see one. One entry per problem.
Append at the end and commit with the private `GIT_INDEX_FILE` recipe — this
file has the same multi-writer collision risk as `CONFORMANCE-FINDINGS.md`.

### The eleven files over 1500 lines

Surveyed 2026-08-27, excluding `tests/` and the generated `generated.rs`
(7721 lines, which is generated and fine):

```text
2317  crates/format/vaco-demux-mp4/src/lib.rs
2018  crates/format/vaco-demux-matroska/src/ebml/schema.rs
1986  crates/format/vaco-demux-matroska/src/demux.rs

1594  crates/format/vaco-demux-mpegts/src/demux.rs
1479  crates/format/vaco-format-core/src/time.rs
```

Length alone is not the problem — `schema.rs` and `table.rs` are declarative
tables and are fine at any length. The ones worth a look are the three in
`vaco-format-core`, because that crate is depended on by nearly everything and
a 1700-line `mux.rs` is where the `add_stream` interface gap hid.

**Not scheduled.** Listed so that the next agent working in one of these has
the number in front of it and can say whether the seam is real.

### `vaco-protocol-*`'s repeated duplex-dial preamble and per-crate `NATIVE_ONLY` paragraph

Landed six protocol crates this session (`crypto`, `httpproxy`, `ftp`,
`gopher`/`gophers`, `icecast`, `ipfs`/`ipns`) under `crates/io/`. Five of them
(`httpproxy`, `ftp`, `gopher`, `gophers`, `icecast`) need to write-then-read
(or otherwise treat a connection as duplex) before they have anything to hand
back through `vaco_protocol_core::Protocol`'s one-direction-only
`open`/`create`, so each independently reproduces the same three things
`vaco-protocol-tls/src/connect.rs` established first:

- a `dial_tcp(hp, env) -> Result<TcpStream>` that is just
  `env.check_scheme("tcp")?; vaco_protocol_socket::addr::connect(hp, None)`,
  byte-for-byte identical across `httpproxy`, `ftp`, `gopher`, and `icecast`;
- a `dial_tls(hp, env) -> Result<TlsStream>` that is just
  `env.check_scheme("tls")?` then `vaco_protocol_tls::connect::{connect_tcp,
  handshake}` with a default `TlsOptions`, identical between `gophers` and
  `icecast`;
- a byte-at-a-time `read_header_block`/response-status reader (to avoid a
  `BufReader` stranding tunnel/body bytes past the header block on the same
  socket that gets handed back) — `vaco-protocol-httpproxy::connect` and
  `vaco-protocol-icecast::protocol` each carry their own copy, differing only
  in the error type's scheme name.

None of this shows up in `cargo xtask dup-check`, because dup-check tracks
type names, not function bodies, and every copy uses a locally appropriate
name. It also means every one of these five crates carries its own paragraph
in `xtask/src/wasm.rs`'s `NATIVE_ONLY` list, each explaining the same
underlying wall (this dial pattern pulls in `vaco-protocol-socket`, and for
`gophers`/`icecast` also `vaco-protocol-tls`) in slightly different words —
five paragraphs that will all need editing together if the measured reason
ever changes.

**Proposed seam:** a small `vaco-protocol-dial` crate (layer 2, depending on
`vaco-protocol-socket`/`-tls`) exporting `dial_tcp`, `dial_tls`, and
`read_header_block` once. Each of the five crates above would shrink by
20-40 lines and lose its own copy of the wasm wall; `xtask/src/wasm.rs`
would carry one `NATIVE_ONLY` entry for `vaco-protocol-dial` instead of five
that have to be kept in sync by hand. **Not fixed here**: it touches
`vaco-protocol-tls` (predates this session, established the pattern first)
and would require re-running the full gate suite against all five
dependents, which is real scope beyond landing issues #546/#550 — flagging
for whoever picks up the next protocol crate that would otherwise become a
sixth copy.

### `s337m` is registered twice, under two different implementations

FM-54 (#612) added `vaco_format_spdif::S337M_DEMUXER`, a real SMPTE 337M
demuxer alongside this crate's spdif/IEC 61937 work. Discovered while
writing the crate's (previously missing — see the registry fix below)
`vaco-component.toml`: `vaco-demux-raw` already registers a demuxer named
`s337m` (`vaco_demux_raw::bitstream::DEMUXER_S337M`, part of its
`BitstreamSpec`-driven sweep of ffmpeg's raw/bitstream demuxer names).
`cargo xtask gen-registry`'s `check_unique` rejects the same name twice
across crates in one kind, so only one can ever be reachable through the
registry.

Left `vaco-format-spdif::S337M_DEMUXER` unregistered rather than picking a
winner — I don't know which of the two implementations is more complete or
correct, and swapping the registry entry to point at a different crate's
symbol is exactly the kind of cross-crate decision that shouldn't be made
by whichever agent happens to notice the collision first. **Proposed
seam:** compare the two (`vaco-demux-raw`'s generic `BitstreamSpec` framing
vs. `vaco-format-spdif`'s dedicated SMPTE 337M parser) against a real
S/PDIF-wrapped bitstream and either register the better one under `s337m`
and delete the other, or split the name space (e.g. `vaco-demux-raw` keeps
`s337m` for the bare bitstream form, `vaco-format-spdif` registers under a
distinct name for the S/PDIF-framed form) if they actually serve different
inputs. Not something `dup-check` catches at all — it checks Rust type
names, not registry component names, so this collision was silent until
`gen-registry` itself refused it.

### Private-index commits, worked example from this session

`GIT_INDEX_FILE` + `write-tree` + `commit-tree` (plan 19 §5/§6) is the
prescribed way to append to a shared, append-only file like this one
without touching the real `.git/index` a concurrent agent may have staged
work in. Worked example, used to write this very entry:

```bash
export GIT_INDEX_FILE=/tmp/vaco-nut-techdebt-$RANDOM.index
git read-tree HEAD
git add planning/TECH-DEBT.md
TREE=$(git write-tree)
COMMIT=$(git commit-tree "$TREE" -p HEAD -m "docs(planning): append NUT/spdif findings to TECH-DEBT")
git update-ref refs/heads/main "$COMMIT"
git read-tree HEAD   # refresh the real index only; never touches the working tree
unset GIT_INDEX_FILE
```
