# Frozen-interface gaps found by the container wave

Interfaces are frozen (plan 19 §8): an agent that finds a signature wrong
reports it and does not change it. Five agents have now reported the same
handful of gaps independently, which is the signal that they are real rather
than one agent's misreading.

**These are wave-boundary changes and belong to the orchestrator.** They cannot
land while agents are writing against the current signatures, so they are queued
here with what each one blocks.

## 1. `Muxer` has no metadata channel

Reported by: `vaco-mux-matroska`, and implied by `vaco-mux-mp4`'s brief.

`Tags`, `Chapters`, `Attachments` and `SeekHead` in Matroska, and
`udta`/`meta`/`ilst` plus chapter tracks in MP4, all need per-file and
per-stream metadata at header-write time. `MuxBuilder::add_stream` carries
`CodecParameters`; there is nowhere to put a title, a language, a chapter list
or an attachment.

**Blocks:** FM-23 (#574, MP4 metadata write), the deferred half of FM-25 (#575),
`ffmetadata` in FM-33 (#590) — which is *entirely* metadata — and every
`-metadata` CLI option in CL-16 (#207).

## 2. `Muxer` is single-sink

Reported by: `vaco-mux-matroska` (`webm_chunk`), and structural for
`vaco-mux-image2`, `segment`/`stream_segment` and `tee`.

A muxer writes to one `IoWriter` for its lifetime. Four registered components
need to open a new output partway through (numbered segments, one file per
image, several sinks at once). `webm_chunk` currently exposes a
`chunk_boundaries()` accessor as a workaround, which is honest but is not the
feature.

**Blocks:** FM-35b (#593), the segment family in FM-33 (#590), `tee`, and
`-f segment` from the CLI.

## 3. `Muxer::write_packet` takes packets, and some muxers want frames

Reported by: `vaco-mux-hash`.

`uncodedframecrc` hashes *decoded frames* and prints their geometry — width,
height and pixel format for video; sample format, layout and sample count for
audio. There is no path for that through a packet-shaped trait, so the muxer is
unregistered and #572 stays open on it alone.

**Blocks:** the last registration of FM-20 (#572).

## 4. `DemuxerDesc::open` has no `Limits` or options parameter

Reported independently by two agents in the container wave.

A demuxer cannot see the allocation budget it is supposed to respect, nor the
`-analyzeduration`/`-probesize`-class options that change how it opens. Today
each demuxer either ignores limits or invents its own defaults, which is the
D19 failure mode: the same concept defined once per crate.

**Blocks:** FW-11 (#537, the 40 generic options), and quietly weakens every
fuzz target — a demuxer that cannot see a budget cannot be fuzzed against one.

## 5. `MuxerDesc::open` carries no options

Reported by: `vaco-mux-mp4`, and `vaco-mux-avi` already had it.

The registry constructs a muxer through `MuxerDesc::open`, whose signature has
no room for `-movflags`, `-fflags` or any other per-muxer option. `vaco-mux-mp4`
works around it with a `MovMuxer::with_options` constructor the registry path
cannot reach, which means every fragmented-MP4 option is unreachable from the
CLI even though it is implemented.

This is the muxer-side twin of gap 4. Both are the same shape — a descriptor
that constructs without seeing the options that change how construction should
go — and they should be fixed together.

**Blocks:** every `-movflags` from the CLI, and the CLI half of FM-22 (#573).

## Sequencing

1 and 4 are additive and can land together behind default-implemented trait
methods, so existing muxers and demuxers keep compiling. 2 and 3 are shape
changes and want their own wave with nothing else running.
